### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a student of front end development with a bachelor degree in Applied Mathematics. I'm currently improving my skills in vanilla Javscript (ES6 Included), HTML, CSS and Bootstrap.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ I am currently working on some small projects, to be able to solidify my skills.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning data strutcures and algorithms in Javascript, as well as practicing HTML, CSS and Bootstrap
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything
